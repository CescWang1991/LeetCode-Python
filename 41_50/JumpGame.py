# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

# We use "last" to keep track of the maximum distance that has been reached
# by using the minimum steps "ret", whereas "curr" is the maximum distance
# that can be reached by using "ret+1" steps. Thus,curr = max(i+A[i]) where 0 <= i <= last.
